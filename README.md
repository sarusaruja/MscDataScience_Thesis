## Causal ML
1. Initially the Nubank credit risk data is tested with the default features, and the overall experimentation steps are performed in the following notebook.
- [Pre_Causal Analysis](https://github.com/sarusaruja/MscDataScience_Thesis/blob/main/Pre_Causal_Model_1.ipynb)
2. Now the Causal Analysis is performed and the causal features are identified with different treatment and outcomes. (i.e.) Condiitional Average Treatment Effect has been performed by understanding the effects of different features on the prediction variable.
  The four models such as Catboost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Network for both Classification and Regression Task has been implemented in the following notebook.
- [Models - Classification](https://github.com/sarusaruja/MscDataScience_Thesis/blob/main/Model_2_3.ipynb)
- [Models - Regression](https://github.com/sarusaruja/MscDataScience_Thesis/blob/main/Model_4.ipynb)
